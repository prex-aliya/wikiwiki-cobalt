# Example

This is an example of a post


# Syntax

## Two spaces

Try to have two returns, or lines, between two Main headers of
the same type. For example before Syntax header


## Continued Two spaces

As seen above two spaces


## EOF 

EOF, or end of file, it is required that you put this vvv
at the bottom, so we have some amount of consistency.
